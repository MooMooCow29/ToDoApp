# TodoApp

## Description

TodoApp is a C++ based task management application that allows users to manage their to-do list efficiently. The application provides features to add, delete, and sort tasks by priority, due date, or completion status. It also supports task recurrence (Daily, Weekly, Monthly), task search by description, and tagging for easy organization. Users can mark tasks as completed, view progress, and back up/restore task data from files.

## Features

- **Add Tasks**: Users can add tasks with a description, priority, due date, tags, and recurrence.
- **Task Completion**: Mark tasks as completed and track completion date.
- **Sort Tasks**: Sort tasks by priority (Low, Medium, High).
- **Search Tasks**: Search for tasks by description.
- **Recurrence**: Supports task recurrence (Daily, Weekly, Monthly).
- **Tags**: Categorize tasks with tags (e.g., Work, Urgent).
- **Backup/Restore**: Backup tasks to a file and restore them when needed.
- **Task Progress**: View task completion progress (not fully implemented yet).

## Installation

   ```

## Usage

1. Start the application by running the executable.
2. The main menu will display a list of options. Use the corresponding number to perform an action.
3. Follow the prompts to add, modify, or search for tasks.
4. Tasks can be backed up and restored from a file named `backup.txt`.

## Example
